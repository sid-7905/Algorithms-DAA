This quote, "Although never is often better than right now," is from the "Zen of Python," a collection of aphorisms that capture the philosophy of Python programming.
The quote suggests that in programming (and in problem-solving more generally), it's often better to avoid doing something immediately, especially if it means doing it hastily or without careful thought. Instead, it may be better not to do it at all ("never") if you're unsure of the best approach. Rushing to implement a solution "right now" can lead to poor decisions, messy code, or unintended consequences.

The idea is to encourage developers to avoid impulsive actions that might seem necessary in the moment but could lead to worse outcomes in the long run. Taking time to plan, consider alternatives, or even deciding not to take a particular action can be more beneficial.
